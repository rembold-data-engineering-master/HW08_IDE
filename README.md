# Homework 8
This repository contains the data and SQL scripts to get you up and running. You have two approaches for this assignment:

* `auto_gen.sql` is a database dump that if you run using `psql` (as `psql -f auto_gen.sql`) will automatically create a new schema named hw8, and then add the necessary tables, data, and constraints.
* `manual_gen.sql` is a starter script that you can use to create the necessary tables and constraints. But then you will need to import the data in from the provided CSV files in the data folder.

As always, ensure that you include both the queries that you used to answer the questions, _as well as your answers to the questions_.
